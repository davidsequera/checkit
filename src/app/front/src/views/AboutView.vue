          <p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            Welcome to the Enron Email Search App! This project aims to provide an accessible and
            user-friendly way for people to explore the extensive collection of emails from the
            Enron Corporation. The data used in this app comes from the Enron Email Dataset, which
            was made public during the legal investigation following the Enron scandal. This dataset
            offers valuable insights into corporate communication and operations. Our goal is to
            facilitate easy exploration of this vast dataset. With a simple and intuitive user
            interface, you can browse through the emails effortlessly. Additionally, the integrated
            search engine allows you to find specific concepts and topics that interest you, making
            it easier to dive deep into the content of these emails. We hope this app serves as a
            useful tool for researchers, students, and anyone interested in understanding more about
            the Enron case and corporate communications in general. Happy exploring!
